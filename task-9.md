Your code is almost correct, but there is a **syntax error** in the `app` service:  
You are missing a colon (`:`) after `ports`.

Here is the corrected version:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
```

**Key corrections:**
- Added a colon after `ports` in the `app` service.
- (Optional but recommended) Use `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password` (with a colon) for consistency in YAML.

**Summary:**  
Your YAML is now valid and will work with Docker Compose!



I have fixed the YAML syntax errors in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

- Added the missing colon after `ports` in the `app` service.
- Ensured the environment variable uses a colon for consistency.

Your file is now valid and ready to use with Docker Compose! If you need further adjustments or explanations, let me know.
