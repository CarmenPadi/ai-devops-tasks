What is DevOps? Explain in 3 sentences.

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), aiming to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering high-quality software continuously. It emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams, breaking down traditional silos through automation, continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD), monitoring, and feedback loops. DevOps culture promotes practices like version control, infrastructure as code, automated testing, and continuous monitoring to ensure faster, more reliable software delivery while maintaining system stability and security.
Based on the most current statistics and market data, here are the 3 most popular tools used in DevOps:

1. Jenkins (46.35% market share)
- Dominates the CI/CD tools market
- Industry standard for continuous integration and continuous delivery
- Automates building, testing, and deployment pipelines

2. Docker (42.77% of DevOps tech stack)
- Leading containerization platform
- Enables packaging software in standardized units called containers
- Used to create automated build and deployment workflows

3. Kubernetes (28.02% of DevOps tech stack)
- Most popular container orchestration platform
- Manages containerized applications at scale
- Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications

These tools are considered essential in modern DevOps practices because:
- Jenkins provides the automation backbone for software delivery
- Docker ensures consistent application packaging and deployment
- Kubernetes handles container orchestration for complex, distributed systems

The high adoption rates of these tools demonstrates their critical role in enabling core DevOps practices like automation, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code.
