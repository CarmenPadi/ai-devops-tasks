Certainly! Here’s an explanation of the relationships between the pipeline stages in the Jenkins pipeline Mermaid diagram:

---

### **1. Checkout Code → Build**
- **Relationship:**  
  The pipeline starts by retrieving the latest source code from the repository. The build stage depends on having the code available to compile or package the application.

### **2. Build → Test**
- **Relationship:**  
  Once the application is built, automated tests (such as unit tests) are run to verify that the build is functional and that recent changes haven’t broken existing features.

### **3. Test → Static Code Analysis**
- **Relationship:**  
  After passing tests, static code analysis tools (like ESLint, SonarQube) examine the code for style, quality, and potential bugs without executing it. This helps catch issues early.

### **4. Static Code Analysis → Security Checks**
- **Relationship:**  
  Once code quality is verified, security checks (such as dependency vulnerability scans or code security analysis) are performed to ensure the application is safe from known threats.

### **5. Security Checks → Build Docker Image**
- **Relationship:**  
  If the code passes security checks, a Docker image is built. This packages the application and its environment for consistent deployment.

### **6. Build Docker Image → Integration Tests**
- **Relationship:**  
  The built Docker image is then used to run integration tests, which verify that different parts of the application work together as expected, often in an environment similar to production.

### **7. Integration Tests → Deploy to Staging**
- **Relationship:**  
  If integration tests pass, the application is deployed to a staging environment. This is a pre-production environment where further manual or automated testing can occur.

### **8. Deploy to Staging → Deploy to Production**
- **Relationship:**  
  After successful validation in staging, the application is deployed to the production environment, making it available to end users.

---

**Summary:**  
Each stage depends on the successful completion of the previous one. This sequential flow ensures that only code that passes all quality, security, and integration checks is deployed to production, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or vulnerabilities.
