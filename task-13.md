Certainly! Hereâ€™s a short explanation of the code:

---

This function, `fetchUserData`, retrieves user information from a remote API using the provided `userId`. It sends a GET request to the API endpoint, checks if the response is successful, and then parses the response as JSON. If successful, it returns an object containing the user's name, email, and last login date (converted to a JavaScript `Date` object). If there is any error during the fetch or if the response is not OK, the function logs the error and returns `null`. The function returns a Promise that resolves to either the user data object or `null` if an error occurs.
