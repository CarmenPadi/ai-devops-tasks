This error occurs when Docker can't start your container because port 3000 is already being used by another process. Here's how to solve it step by step:

1. **First, check what's using port 3000**

```bash
# On Linux/Mac
sudo lsof -i :3000

# On Windows (PowerShell)
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```

2. **Stop the conflicting process**

```bash
# Option 1: Kill the process using its PID (Process ID)
kill -9 <PID>

# Option 2: If it's another Docker container, stop it
docker ps | grep 3000
docker stop <container_id>
```

3. **Alternative solutions:**

a. **Use a different port** in your docker-compose.yml or docker run command:
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"  # Maps host port 3001 to container port 3000
```

b. **Stop all containers and remove networks**:
```bash
# Stop all running containers
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)

# Remove all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

# Remove all networks
docker network prune
```

c. **Check and remove any stale containers**:
```bash
# List all containers (including stopped ones)
docker ps -a

# Remove specific container
docker rm <container_id>
```

4. **Then try running your container again**:
```bash
docker-compose up
# or
docker run ...
```

5. **If the problem persists**, restart the Docker daemon:
```bash
# On Linux
sudo systemctl restart docker

# On Windows/Mac
Restart Docker Desktop
```

Remember: The format for port mapping is `HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT`. If you change the host port (left side), you'll need to update your application URLs accordingly.

Let me break down this error and explain how to fix it:

```
ERROR: for app Cannot start service app: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint app (172.18.0.2):
Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:3000: bind: address already in use
```

### What the Error Means:
- Something is already using port 3000 on your machine
- Docker can't start your container because it can't bind to that port
- Only one process can use a port at a time

### How to Fix It:

1. **Find what's using port 3000**:
```bash
# Linux/Mac
sudo lsof -i :3000

# Windows (PowerShell)
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
```

2. **Choose a solution**:

A. **Stop the conflicting process**
```bash
# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
```

B. **Use a different port** (Recommended)
```yaml
# In docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    ports:
      - "3001:3000"   # Host:Container
```
or
```bash
# With docker run
docker run -p 3001:3000 your-image
```

C. **Stop existing containers**
```bash
# Stop all containers
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)

# Remove unused containers
docker container prune
```

3. **Verify and restart**:
```bash
# Check no containers are using the port
docker ps

# Start your container again
docker-compose up
```

### Prevention Tips:
1. Always check running containers before starting new ones
2. Use different ports for different services
3. Document your port usage
4. Consider using `.env` files to manage ports
