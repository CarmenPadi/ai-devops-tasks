Here are **5 key security practices** for Docker applications in production:

1. **Use Minimal and Official Base Images**  
   - Start your Dockerfiles with official, minimal images (like Alpine or slim variants) to reduce the attack surface and avoid unnecessary packages.

2. **Run Containers as a Non-Root User**  
   - Avoid running your application as the root user inside the container. Create and use a dedicated user with limited permissions in your Dockerfile.

3. **Keep Images and Dependencies Up to Date**  
   - Regularly update your base images and application dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `docker scan` or `Trivy` to check for vulnerabilities.

4. **Limit Container Capabilities and Resource Access**  
   - Use Docker’s security options to restrict container privileges (e.g., `--cap-drop`, `--read-only`, `--no-new-privileges`). Limit access to host resources and networks.

5. **Use Secrets Management and Avoid Hardcoding Sensitive Data**  
   - Never store secrets (passwords, API keys) in images or environment variables. Use Docker secrets, external secret managers, or orchestrator features to inject secrets securely at runtime.

**Bonus:**  
- Enable logging and monitoring for containers.
- Regularly scan images for vulnerabilities.
- Use signed images and verify image integrity.

These practices help reduce risks and protect your Dockerized applications in production environments.

Great question! Here’s how you can implement the **first security practice**—using minimal and official base images—in both your `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`:

---

### **1. Dockerfile**

- **Use an official, minimal base image** (e.g., `node:18-alpine` instead of `node:18`):

```dockerfile
# Use official minimal Node.js image
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

**Why?**  
- The `-alpine` variant is much smaller and contains fewer packages, reducing the attack surface.

---

### **2. docker-compose.yml**

- **Reference your Dockerfile as usual** (no changes needed for minimal base image, but always use your own Dockerfile):

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

- **Or, if using an official image directly:**

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
```

**Tips:**
- Always specify the full image name and tag (e.g., `nginx:alpine`, `python:3.12-slim`).
- Avoid using `latest` or unofficial images.

### **Summary Table**

| File                | What to do                                      | Example                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Dockerfile          | Use minimal official base image                 | `FROM node:18-alpine`          |
| docker-compose.yml  | Reference your Dockerfile or minimal image      | `image: nginx:alpine`          |

---

**In summary:**  
Choose minimal, official images in your Dockerfile’s `FROM` line and reference those images (or your Dockerfile) in your `docker-compose.yml`. This reduces vulnerabilities and keeps your containers lean and secure.
